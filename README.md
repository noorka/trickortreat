##System Requirements
Ability to run Java

#How to play

##Start
The first thing to print will be an ajustment screen - adjust the height and width of your console window so the stars on the right and left side line up.  Once you have done so, type any number and hit enter.

##Welcome to Hallowe'en!
You have two and a half hours to trick or treat, so use your time wisely.

##Choose a costume
Each costume has a set of traits associated with it - Cuteness, Scariness, Speed, and Movement.  Cuteness and scariness will effect how much candy you can get from certain houses.  Speed and movement will effect how quickly you can move from house, and your chances of getting away with a trick successfully.

##Choose a neighborhood
Your neighborhood will have the least amount of candy held by the houses, but you will not waste any time getting there.  The other neightborhoods will have better houses with more candy, but you will have to travel there, which will take time out of your total allotted time.

##Start your night
You have two and half hours to trick or treat.  There are a limited number of houses in each neighborhood, and once you have visited every hosue in the neighborhood, your night will be over.  You have two options on how to spend your time.

1. Tricking - Go play pranks on houses.  Your speed and movement scores will effect if your trick will be successful or not.  Bulky costumes (like princess) are harder to move around in and escape, whereas less encumbered costumes (like superhero) have a better chance of success in this case.  When you are successful at a trick, you get a tricker point.
2. Treating - Go ring the doorbell and get some candy!  Each house has a preference on whether they prefer cuter custumes, spookier costumes, or they enjoy both equally.  If your costume corresponds with the preferences of the house you visit, you will get more candy.

Throughout the night you can check how much candy you have gained, how many trickster points you have gained, and how much time you have left in the night.  You also have the option to go home and end the game at any point.
